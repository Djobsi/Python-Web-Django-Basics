The Django Basics course will lay the foundations of Web programming with Python and Django. It will look at how networks actually work, what HTTP is, and what the basic principles of web development are. The course will examine the main concepts in the MTV (Model–Template–View) architecture, such as Function-Based Views, Class-Based Views, and in addition to them, forms (Form and ModelForm) will be used for application development, works with media files, and the data will be stored in PostgreSQL.

The training includes practical exercises (labs) and workshops for building complete, fully functional Django web applications.
